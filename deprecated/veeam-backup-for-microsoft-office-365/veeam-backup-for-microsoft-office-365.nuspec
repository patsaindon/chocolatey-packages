<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description><![CDATA[DEPRECATED!

Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 is a comprehensive solution that allows you to back up and restore data of your Microsoft Office 365, on-premises Microsoft Exchange and on-premises Microsoft SharePoint organizations, including Microsoft OneDrive for Business.

This package installs the following software by default:

* Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 Server
* Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 Console
* Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 PowerShell

To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

### Package Parameters

The package accepts the following optional parameters:

* `/server` - Only install Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 Server
* `/console` - Only install Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 Console
* `/powershell` - Only install Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 PowerShell

**NOTE** These parameters can be combined. e.g. `-params '"/server /powershell"'` to only install Server and PowerShell parts.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
