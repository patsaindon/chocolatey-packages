## Description

TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. Our goal is to make writing LaTeX as easy and comfortable as possible. Therefore TeXstudio has numerous features like syntax-highlighting, integrated viewer, reference checking and various assistants.

If you want to use MiKTeX make sure to install it before TeXstudio! Unless you don't want to compile documents or you know what you do, you will need MiKTeX.
