## Description

WirelessNetView is a small utility that runs in the background, and monitor the activity of wireless networks around you.

For each detected network, it displays the following information: SSID, Last Signal Quality, Average Signal Quality, Detection Counter, Authentication Algorithm, Cipher Algorithm, MAC Address, RSSI, Channel Frequency, Channel Number, and more.

**NOTE** high virus count! This happens because some Antivirus programs trigger alerts for any freeware tools that can be used by hackers to get information.
