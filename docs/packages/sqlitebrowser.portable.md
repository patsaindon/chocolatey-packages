## Description

## DB Browser for SQLite

DB Browser for SQLite is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

It is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search, and edit data. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Create and compact database files
* Create, define, modify and delete tables
* Create, define and delete indexes
* Browse, edit, add and delete records
* Search records
* Import and export records as text
* Import and export tables from/to CSV files
* Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
* Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
* Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application

### Previous names

This project has previously been known as __SQLite Browser__ and __Database Browser for SQLite__.

In August 2014, the project was renamed to __Database Browser for SQLite__ at the request of [Richard Hipp](http://www.hwaci.com/drh) (creator of [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/)), as the previous name was creating unintended support issues.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
