## Description

Firefox Nightly builds are under active development and should be used only by advanced users for testing experimental features.

## Package Parameters

- `l=<locale>` - Install given Firefox locale. For example `choco install Firefox --params "l=en-GB"`. See the [official page](https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/latest/README.txt) for a complete list of available locales.

#### Firefox channels (development cycle)

Every 6 weeks, Firefox developers take the current stable features of each build and introduce them into the next stable channel for further development. The Developer Edition is a special build containing features never moved forward since they would be rarely used by the average user and needlessly consume resources.
