## Description

**x3270** is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System and Windows. It runs on most Unix-like operating systems -- e.g., Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Cygwin. It also runs natively on Windows.

**x3270** runs over a TELNET connection, emulating either an IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome). It supports:

- The full TN3270E protocol
- SSL/TLS (via the OpenSSL library) for encrypted sessions
- APL2 characters
- Non-English character sets, including Russian, Turkish, Hebrew and DBCS Chinese and Japanese
- IND$FILE file transfer
- NVT mode (emulating a color xterm)
- A pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys
- A scrollbar
- Printer session integration
- Extensive debugging and scripting facilities

It does not yet support graphics. **x3270** is distributed as source code, and can be used for free.

**x3270** is available in several different forms:

- **x3270** is for use on an X graphics display
- **c3270** is a curses-based version for use on a dumb terminal (e.g., a serial terminal or a Linux console)
- **wc3270** is the Windows console version of **c3270**
- **s3270** is a displayless version for writing screen-scraping scripts
- **ws3270** is the native Windows version of **s3270**
- **tcl3270** is similar to **s3270**, but integrated with **Tcl**
- **pr3287** is for printer emulation
- **wpr3287** is the native Windows version of **pr3287**

Also available is x026, an IBM 026 Keypunch emulator.
