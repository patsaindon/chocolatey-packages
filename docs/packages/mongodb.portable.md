## Description

MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database written in C++.

MongoDB stores data using a flexible document data model that is similar to JSON. Documents contain one or more fields, including arrays, binary data and sub-documents. Fields can vary from document to document. This flexibility allows development teams to evolve the data model rapidly as their application requirements change.

Developers access documents through rich, idiomatic drivers available in all popular programming languages. Documents map naturally to the objects in modern languages, which allows developers to be extremely productive. Typically, there’s no need for an ORM layer.

#### Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set:

* `/installDir:` - set the installation directory of MongoDB - defaults to "$env:ChocolateyToolsLocation" A new folder "mongodb" will be created in that folder

To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'"`).
To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
