This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description><![CDATA[## ZeroTier - Global Area Networking

ZeroTier is a smart programmable Ethernet switch for planet Earth. It allows networked devices and applications to be managed as if the entire world is one data center or cloud region.

It replaces the physical LAN/WAN boundary with a virtual one, allowing devices of any type at any location to be managed as if they all reside in the same cloud region or data center. All traffic is encrypted end-to-end and takes the most direct path available for minimum latency and maximum performance. The goals and design of ZeroTier are inspired by among other things the original [Google BeyondCorp](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43231.pdf) paper and the [Jericho Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Forum).

Visit [ZeroTier's site](https://www.zerotier.com/) for more information and [pre-built binary packages](https://www.zerotier.com/download/). Apps for Android and iOS are available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores.

### Getting Started

Everything in the ZeroTier world is controlled by two types of identifier: 40-bit/10-digit *ZeroTier addresses* and 64-bit/16-digit *network IDs*. A ZeroTier address identifies a node or "device" (laptop, phone, server, VM, app, etc.) while a network ID identifies a virtual Ethernet network that can be joined by devices.

Another way of thinking about it is that ZeroTier addresses are port numbers on a giant planetary-sized smart switch while network IDs are VLANs to which these ports can be assigned. For more details read about VL1 and VL2 in [the ZeroTier manual](https://www.zerotier.com/manual/).
ZeroTier is a smart switch for Earth with VLAN capability. See [https://www.zerotier.com/](https://www.zerotier.com/) for more information.

*Network controllers* are ZeroTier nodes that act as access control certificate authorities and configuration managers for virtual networks. The first 40 bits (or 10 digits) of a network ID is the ZeroTier address of its controller. You can create networks with our [hosted controllers](https://my.zerotier.com/) and web UI/API or [host your own](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/controller/) if you don't mind posting some JSON configuration info or writing a script to do so.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
