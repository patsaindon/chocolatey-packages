Veeam Backup & Replication comes with an extract utility that can be used to recover machines from backup files. The extract utility does not require any interaction with Veeam Backup & Replication and can be used as an independent tool.

The extract utility can be helpful, for example, if it is written to the tape next to machine backup files. In this case, you get a possibility to recover machines from backups at any moment of time even if backups are removed from Veeam Backup & Replication or Veeam Backup & Replication is uninstalled at all.

IMPORTANT!

The extract utility does not work with backups that are stored on scale-out backup repositories.

The extract utility can be used in two interfaces:

Graphic user interface (GUI)
Command-line interface working in the interactive and regular mode

Veeam.Backup.Extractor.exe — utility working in GUI
extract.exe — utility working in the command-line interface
