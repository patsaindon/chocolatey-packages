**NOTE** This package requires Word 2010 or higher to be installed.

The main idea of Writage is providing opportunity to write in Markdown to those who like Microsoft Word. There are lots of Markdown editors such as iA Writer, Texts, WriteMonkey or Byword and online Markdown writing services, like StackEdit, Dillinger or Markable for people who like to have minimalistic, distraction-free interface. And there is nothing for those who prefer to use rich interface and features of Microsoft Word.

So Writage is designed for everyone who likes to start writing well-structured documents and don't have time or don't want to drill into details Markdown syntax or prefer to use Word as a text editor.

Writage enables Microsoft Word to create and edit Markdown files (with .md .markdown or .text extensions). You could also save your .doc file as Markdown file.

The following Markdown elements are supported:

- Headings
- Lists (numbered and bulleted)
- Links
- Font styles such as bold, italic
- Tables
- Footnotes

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
