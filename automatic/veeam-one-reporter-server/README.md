## Exit when reboot detected

When installing / upgrading these packages, I would like to advise you to enable this feature `choco feature enable -n=exitOnRebootDetected`

## Veeam ONE Server

**Veeam ONE Server** is responsible for collecting data from virtual servers, vCloud Director servers and Veeam Backup & Replication servers, and storing this data into the database. As part of Veeam ONE Server, the following components should be installed: Veeam ONE Monitor Server and Veeam ONE Reporter Server.

## Manual steps

You'll need an SQL Server (express) installed. It's not required to have this installed on this server. You'll need to specify parameters to connect to the SQL Server.

This package requires you to install the IIS Windows feature and WAS Configuration API feature. You can install these by executing `choco install IIS-WebServer WAS-ConfigurationAPI --source windowsfeatures`
