<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description><![CDATA[## Microsoft Visual Studio Live Share

Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless what [programming languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/platform-support#visual-studio-code) you're using or app types you're building. It allows you to instantly (and [securely](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/security)) share your current project, and then as needed, share [debugging sessions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#co-debugging), [terminal instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#share-a-terminal), [localhost web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#share-a-server), [voice calls](https://aka.ms/vsls-audio), and more! Developers that join your sessions recieve all of their editor context from your environment (e.g. language services, debugging), which ensures they can start productively collaborating immediately, without needing to clone any repos or install any SDKs.

Additionally, unlike traditional pair programming, Visual Studio Live Share allows developers to work together, while retaining their personal editor preferences (e.g. theme, keybindings), as well as having their own cursor. This allows you to seamlessly transition between [following one another](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#following), and being able to explore ideas/tasks on your own. In practice, this ability to work together _and_ independently provides a collaboration experience that is potentiallty more natural for many [common use cases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/use-cases).

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
