[Helio Workstation](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.

## Why another sequencer

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem [overcomplicated](http://mashable.com/2015/09/18/german-u-boat/), and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.
